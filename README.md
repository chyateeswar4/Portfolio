## 🚀 AWS Cloud Projects
### ✅ **Scalable & Secure AWS Cloud Infrastructure for Healthcare SaaS**
- Achieved **~99.95% uptime** using AWS Auto Scaling, ELB for traffic distribution, and Multi-AZ RDS for fault tolerance.  
- Reduced infrastructure provisioning time by **70%** using **CloudFormation & Terraform** for automated deployments.  
- Enhanced security with **IAM & AWS WAF**, enforcing least privilege access and mitigating cyber threats.  
- Improved disaster recovery time by **80%** using **AWS Backup & automated RDS Multi-AZ failover**.  

### ✅ **Intelligent Serverless Image Recognition on AWS**
- Reduced manual inspection time by **90%** by automating image-based quality checks with **AWS Rekognition**.  
- Achieved **~95% processing efficiency** using **AWS SQS and Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)** for smooth handling of concurrent analyses.  
- Optimized data retention by automating lifecycle policies in **S3**, archiving inspection records in **Amazon Glacier**.  
- Enhanced monitoring with **IAM, CloudWatch, and SNS notifications**, providing real-time logs and audit tracking.  

### ✅ **Heart Disease Prediction Model (Random Forest)**  
- Designed and implemented a **predictive model** leveraging the Random Forest algorithm to analyze medical data and predict heart disease risks.  
- Enhanced data quality through **comprehensive preprocessing** (cleaning data, handling missing values, and feature engineering).  
- Achieved high accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters, contributing to **early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures**.
